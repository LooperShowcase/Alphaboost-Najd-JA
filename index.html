      EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes
      sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in
      which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling
      themselves the "EA Sports Network" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements
      with real commentators such as John Madden, it soon grew up to become a
      sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as FIFA, NHL, NBA Live
      and Madden NFL. Most games under this brand are developed by EA Vancouver,
      the Electronic Arts studio in Burnaby, British Columbia as well as EA
      Tiburon in Maitland, Florida. The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports.
      Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games, with 2K
      releasing the NBA 2K series. Konami is its rival in association football
      games with their own series, eFootball. For several years after the brand
      was created, all EA Sports games began with a stylized five-second video
      introducing the brand with Andrew Anthony voicing its motto, "It's in the
      game", meaning that its games aimed at simulating the actual sports as
      authentically and completely as possible;[1] Anthony was never compensated
      for his appearance and did it merely as a favour to a friend.[2] Unlike
      some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a
      single platform, which means that all games are released for the
      best-selling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other
      companies abandon them. For example, FIFA 98, Madden NFL 98, NBA Live 98,
      and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout
      1997; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation releases in 2004 (FIFA
      2005 and Madden NFL 2005 were also the last two PlayStation titles to be
      released); and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox release in 2007. Madden NFL 08
      also had Xbox and GameCube releases in 2007, and was the final title
      released for the GameCube, with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox
      title. Additionally, NASCAR Thunder 2003 and NASCAR Thunder 2004 were
      released not only for the PlayStation 2, but for the original PlayStation
      as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English Football League
      Two team Swindon Town F.C. from the 2009â€“10 season onward and the EA
      Sports Cup in the Republic of Ireland. In July 2021, hackers who breached
      Electronic Arts in June 2021, have released the entire cache of stolen
      data after failing to extort the company and later sell the stolen files
      to a third-party buyer.[3]

      Established in 1982 by William M. (“Trip”) Hawkins, Electronic Arts (EA)
      A fan of the Strat-O-Matic Football pen and paper games, Hawkins started his first business as a teenager trying to create a knockoff version. He borrowed $5,000 from his father to start up the venture and advertised his game in NFL Game Programs, but the business failed. Eventually, he received his first computer and became interested in creating a digital football game, because it would allow players to avoid the challenging math of the game were all handled internally.[3] he designed his own undergraduate major at Harvard University in Strategy and Applied Game Theory.[4]

      Around this time, in 1975, Hawkins estimated that it would take home computer saturation seven years to make a viable career out of game design.[3] He was the Director of Strategy and Marketing at Apple Computer in 1982 when he left to found Electronic Arts (EA), a video game publisher. EA was successful for many years under his leadership. He has been credited with spearheading the games industry's evolution from simple one-person creations to complex team projects during this time.[5] One of his first big wins was to sign John Madden on as a spokesperson and a consultant to his company's football game which would eventually lead to the popular Madden NFL series of video games.[3]
